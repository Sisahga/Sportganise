## Project Summary
This project is a website and mobile application designed for Accès Badminton, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting badminton in the Greater Montreal Area. Our application serves as a central platform where players, coaches, and administrators can easily register, log in, and access essential information related to training sessions, upcoming events, competitions, and more. The app features a robust messaging tool to enhance internal communication between coaches and players, a real-time calendar displaying all events, and a feedback section for players to review training sessions. Through this app, players can connect, find partners for competitions, stay updated on club activities, and engage in club events. Additionally, we’ve built the application to be versatile, extending its functionality beyond badminton to any sports club or team. This adaptability allows clubs of various sizes to leverage the app for managing schedules, coordinating teams, and handling administrative tasks, ultimately supporting clubs in streamlining their operations and enhancing their management capabilities.

## Developer getting started guide
This monorepo project is home to two workspaces: frontend and backend.

As a developer, it is recommended to open the editor (e.g. VS Code) in one of these
two folders instead of in the root of the project.


## Frontend - Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Backend - Getting Started 

A wonderful java app.

### Commands

NOTE: On windows systems, use the `./mvnw.cmd` script. On unix systems, use `./mvnw` instead.

- run: `./mvnw sprint-boot:run`
- test: `./mvnw test`
- format: `./mvnw spotless:apply`
- lint: `./mvnw stylecheck:check`
